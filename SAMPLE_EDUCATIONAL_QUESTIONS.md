## Question 1: Covenant Theology (Scholar)

**Category:** Theological Concepts
**Difficulty:** Scholar
**Type:** Multiple Choice

**Question:**
What was the sign of the Abrahamic Covenant that God established with Abraham and his descendants?

**Options:**
- A) The rainbow
- B) Circumcision
- C) The Sabbath
- D) Burnt offerings

**Correct Answer:** Circumcision

**Bible Reference:** Genesis 17:9-14

**Explanation:**
God commanded Abraham and all males in his household to be circumcised as a physical sign of the covenant relationship. This distinguished God's covenant people and pointed forward to the need for spiritual circumcision of the heart (Romans 2:28-29).

**Teaching Notes:**
The Abrahamic Covenant is foundational to understanding biblical theology. It includes three key promises: land (Canaan), seed (descendants), and blessing (to all nations through Abraham's offspring, ultimately fulfilled in Christ - Galatians 3:16). The sign of circumcision represents both the cutting away of sin and the consecration of God's people. Paul later argues that physical circumcision was a shadow pointing to the reality of heart transformation through faith (Colossians 2:11-12). This covenant is unconditional, based on God's initiative, unlike the conditional Mosaic Covenant that followed.

## Question 2: Gospel Chronology (Intermediate)

**Category:** Events
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Type:** Multiple Choice

**Question:**
Which event immediately followed Jesus' baptism by John in the Jordan River?

**Options:**
- A) The calling of the twelve disciples
- B) The wedding at Cana
- C) Forty days of temptation in the wilderness
- D) The cleansing of the temple

**Correct Answer:** Forty days of temptation in the wilderness

**Bible Reference:** Matthew 3:13-4:11; Mark 1:9-13; Luke 3:21-4:13

**Explanation:**
After Jesus was baptized and the Spirit descended on Him like a dove, the Spirit immediately led Him into the wilderness where He fasted for forty days and was tempted by Satan. This tested Jesus' identity as the Son of God before He began His public ministry.

**Teaching Notes:**
The sequence is significant: baptism (public identification with humanity and sinners), Spirit's anointing (empowerment for ministry), and wilderness testing (proving His obedience where Israel failed). The forty days parallel Israel's forty years in the wilderness. Where Israel failed their testing by grumbling and idolatry, Jesus succeeded by relying on Scripture and trusting the Father. Jesus quotes three times from Deuteronomy (6:13, 6:16, 8:3), showing He is the true Israel who perfectly obeys God's word. This victory over temptation qualified Him to be our sinless High Priest (Hebrews 4:15).

## Question 3: Prophetic Ministry (Expert)

**Category:** Characters
**Difficulty:** Expert
**Type:** Multiple Choice

**Question:**
Which prophet was commanded by God to marry a prostitute as an object lesson about Israel's unfaithfulness?

**Options:**
- A) Jeremiah
- B) Ezekiel
- C) Hosea
- D) Isaiah

**Correct Answer:** Hosea

**Bible Reference:** Hosea 1:2-3

**Explanation:**
God told Hosea to marry Gomer, a woman of promiscuity, and to love her despite her unfaithfulness. This enacted parable illustrated how Israel had committed spiritual adultery by worshiping other gods, yet God continued to love and pursue His covenant people.

**Teaching Notes:**
Hosea's marriage is one of the most poignant prophetic sign-acts in Scripture. The prophet's personal suffering mirrors God's heartbreak over Israel's covenant unfaithfulness. The book alternates between judgment oracles and tender appeals for repentance. Chapter 11 reveals God's fatherly love ("Out of Egypt I called my son" - Matthew 2:15 applies this to Jesus). The restoration promise in Hosea 2:14-23 shows God wooing Israel back like a husband courting his bride. This prophetic metaphor of marriage between God and His people reaches its fulfillment in Christ's relationship with the Church (Ephesians 5:25-32). Hosea demonstrates that God's love is not based on our faithfulness but on His covenant commitment.

## Question 4: Resurrection Appearances (Beginner)

**Category:** Events
**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Type:** Multiple Choice

**Question:**
Who was the first person to see Jesus after His resurrection?

**Options:**
- A) Peter
- B) John
- C) Mary Magdalene
- D) Thomas

**Correct Answer:** Mary Magdalene

**Bible Reference:** John 20:10-18; Mark 16:9

**Explanation:**
Mary Magdalene came to Jesus' tomb early on Sunday morning and found it empty. When she saw Jesus, she at first thought He was the gardener, but He revealed Himself by calling her name. She became the first witness of the resurrection and was sent to tell the disciples.

**Teaching Notes:**
The fact that Jesus appeared first to a woman is remarkable given that women's testimony was not considered legally valid in first-century Judaism. This authenticates the Gospel accounts, as no one inventing a story would have women as the primary witnesses. Mary's encounter demonstrates Jesus' care for the marginalized and His reversal of cultural expectations. When Jesus calls her name, it echoes the Good Shepherd who calls His sheep by name (John 10:3). Her commission to "go and tell" makes her an "apostle to the apostles." This fulfills Jesus' promise that He would not leave His followers as orphans but would reveal Himself to them (John 14:18-21).

## Question 5: Biblical Law (Intermediate)

**Category:** Teachings
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Type:** Multiple Choice

**Question:**
According to Jesus, which two commandments summarize all the Law and the Prophets?

**Options:**
- A) Do not murder and do not steal
- B) Keep the Sabbath and honor your parents
- C) Love God with all your heart and love your neighbor as yourself
- D) Believe in God and be baptized

**Correct Answer:** Love God with all your heart and love your neighbor as yourself

**Bible Reference:** Matthew 22:37-40

**Explanation:**
When asked which commandment was greatest, Jesus quoted Deuteronomy 6:5 (love God) and Leviticus 19:18 (love neighbor), saying all the Law and Prophets hang on these two commands. This shows that the entire Old Testament points toward love as the fulfillment of God's requirements.

**Teaching Notes:**
Jesus' answer brilliantly synthesizes the vertical (love for God) and horizontal (love for others) dimensions of righteousness. These two commands correspond to the two tablets of the Ten Commandments: commandments 1-4 concern our relationship with God, and 5-10 concern our relationships with others. Paul echoes this in Romans 13:8-10, stating that love is the fulfillment of the law. This doesn't abolish specific commands but reveals their purpose. The Pharisees had multiplied laws (Talmud lists 613 commandments), but Jesus simplified them to their core intent. However, this simplification doesn't make obedience easier—loving God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength is actually an impossible standard apart from God's grace, driving us to depend on Christ's perfect love imputed to us.

## Question 6: Pauline Theology (Scholar)

**Category:** Theological Concepts
**Difficulty:** Scholar
**Type:** Multiple Choice

**Question:**
In Romans 5, Paul contrasts Adam and Christ. What theological concept does Paul develop through this comparison?

**Options:**
- A) Individual moral responsibility
- B) Federal headship and representative substitution
- C) Progressive sanctification
- D) Election and predestination

**Correct Answer:** Federal headship and representative substitution

**Bible Reference:** Romans 5:12-21

**Explanation:**
Paul presents Adam and Christ as two representative heads of humanity. Through Adam's one act of disobedience, sin and death entered the world and affected all people. Through Christ's one act of obedience, righteousness and life are made available to all who are in Him.

**Teaching Notes:**
This passage is foundational for understanding original sin and imputed righteousness. Adam served as the federal head (representative) of humanity, so his sin is credited to all his descendants. Christ, as the "last Adam" (1 Corinthians 15:45), serves as the new head of redeemed humanity. The parallel structure Paul uses is called a "fortiori" argument ("how much more"): if Adam's sin had such devastating universal effects, how much greater are the effects of Christ's righteousness! This isn't about individual acts but about corporate representation. We're "in Adam" by natural birth and "in Christ" by spiritual rebirth. The doctrine of imputation is key: Adam's guilt is imputed to us, and Christ's righteousness is imputed to believers (2 Corinthians 5:21). This challenges both Pelagianism (we're not neutral beings capable of choosing good) and works-righteousness (we can't earn salvation).

## Question 7: Old Testament Wisdom (Expert)

**Category:** Books of the Bible
**Difficulty:** Expert
**Type:** Multiple Choice

**Question:**
Which book of the Bible explores the problem of suffering through the story of a righteous man who loses everything?

**Options:**
- A) Ecclesiastes
- B) Proverbs
- C) Job
- D) Lamentations

**Correct Answer:** Job

**Bible Reference:** Job 1:1-2:13

**Explanation:**
The book of Job tells the story of a blameless and upright man who feared God and shunned evil. Despite his righteousness, he lost his children, wealth, and health, prompting profound questions about why the righteous suffer.

**Teaching Notes:**
Job is probably the oldest book in the Bible and grapples with theodicy—the problem of evil and suffering in a world governed by a good and sovereign God. Unlike Proverbs' wisdom of retribution (the righteous prosper, the wicked suffer), Job shows that suffering isn't always punishment for sin. The book has a cosmic framework: Satan challenges whether Job serves God out of pure devotion or self-interest (Job 1:9-11). God permits the test but sets limits. Job's three friends represent conventional wisdom theology, insisting Job must have sinned. Job maintains his innocence and demands an answer from God. When God finally speaks (chapters 38-41), He doesn't explain suffering but reveals His sovereign wisdom and power through creation. Job's response is worship, not because he got answers but because he encountered God. The book teaches that suffering can be a test of faith, that we won't always understand God's purposes, and that right relationship with God matters more than comfortable circumstances. Christ is the ultimate fulfillment—the truly innocent sufferer (Isaiah 53).

## Question 8: Early Church (Intermediate)

**Category:** Events
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Type:** Multiple Choice

**Question:**
What miraculous event occurred on the Day of Pentecost that marked the birth of the Church?

**Options:**
- A) Jesus appeared to 500 people
- B) The temple veil was torn in two
- C) The Holy Spirit came upon the disciples like tongues of fire
- D) An earthquake opened the prison doors

**Correct Answer:** The Holy Spirit came upon the disciples like tongues of fire

**Bible Reference:** Acts 2:1-4

**Explanation:**
Fifty days after Jesus' resurrection, while the disciples were gathered together, the Holy Spirit came upon them with the sound of a rushing wind and what appeared to be tongues of fire resting on each person. They began to speak in other languages, enabling them to proclaim the gospel to Jews from every nation gathered in Jerusalem.

**Teaching Notes:**
Pentecost (Greek for "fiftieth") was originally the Jewish Feast of Weeks, celebrating the wheat harvest (Leviticus 23:15-22) and traditionally commemorating the giving of the Law at Sinai. The parallels are striking: just as God gave the Law to Israel at Sinai with fire and thunder, He now gives the Spirit with fire and wind, writing the law on hearts (Jeremiah 31:33). The miracle of tongues reverses the curse of Babel (Genesis 11), where God confused languages and scattered humanity. At Pentecost, people from all nations hear the gospel in their own language, foreshadowing the global mission of the Church. This fulfills Jesus' promise in Acts 1:8 and John 14:16-17. The 3,000 converts (Acts 2:41) parallel the 3,000 who died at Sinai after the golden calf (Exodus 32:28), showing that the Spirit gives life while the letter kills (2 Corinthians 3:6). Pentecost marks the transition from the age of promise to the age of fulfillment.

## Question 9: Messianic Prophecy (Expert)

**Category:** Prophecy
**Difficulty:** Expert
**Type:** Multiple Choice

**Question:**
In Isaiah 53, the Suffering Servant is described with which of these characteristics?

**Options:**
- A) A conquering military leader who defeats Israel's enemies
- B) One who was pierced for our transgressions and crushed for our iniquities
- C) A wise teacher who establishes schools throughout Israel
- D) A wealthy king who rebuilds the temple

**Correct Answer:** One who was pierced for our transgressions and crushed for our iniquities

**Bible Reference:** Isaiah 53:5

**Explanation:**
Isaiah 53 prophetically describes the Suffering Servant who would bear the sins of others. He would be wounded, pierced, and crushed not for His own sins but for the sins of the people. This prophecy was fulfilled in Jesus Christ's crucifixion.

**Teaching Notes:**
Isaiah 53 is one of the most remarkable messianic prophecies in the Old Testament, written 700 years before Christ's birth. It depicts a suffering figure who bears the punishment deserved by others—a concept of vicarious, substitutionary atonement that was revolutionary in ancient Near Eastern religion. Key details fulfilled in Christ: despised and rejected (v.3), silent before accusers (v.7), crucified with criminals (v.12), buried in a rich man's tomb (v.9), and making "many righteous" through His sacrifice (v.11). The New Testament quotes or alludes to Isaiah 53 over 40 times. Philip used this passage to explain Jesus to the Ethiopian eunuch (Acts 8:32-35). The prophecy answers three key questions: Who suffers? The Servant. Why does He suffer? For our sins, not His own. What does His suffering accomplish? Healing, peace, and justification. This challenges Jewish expectations of a conquering political Messiah and reveals God's upside-down kingdom where the path to glory leads through suffering.

## Question 10: Faith and Works (Scholar)

**Category:** Theological Concepts
**Difficulty:** Scholar
**Type:** Multiple Choice

**Question:**
James writes that "faith without works is dead." How does this relate to Paul's teaching that we are justified by faith apart from works?

**Options:**
- A) James and Paul contradict each other on the doctrine of salvation
- B) James refers to ceremonial works while Paul refers to moral works
- C) Paul speaks of how we are justified before God (by faith alone), while James speaks of how genuine faith is demonstrated before others (by works)
- D) James was written before Paul's letters and represents a less mature theology

**Correct Answer:** Paul speaks of how we are justified before God (by faith alone), while James speaks of how genuine faith is demonstrated before others (by works)

**Bible Reference:** James 2:14-26; Romans 3:28; Ephesians 2:8-10

**Explanation:**
Paul and James are addressing different questions. Paul argues against those who thought they could earn salvation through works of the law—justification is by faith alone. James argues against those who claimed to have faith but showed no evidence of transformation—genuine saving faith will inevitably produce good works as fruit.

**Teaching Notes:**
This apparent tension has been debated since the Reformation. Luther famously called James an "epistle of straw" because he thought it contradicted Paul. However, the two are complementary. Paul's concern is the *root* of salvation (faith, not works). James' concern is the *fruit* of salvation (works as evidence of genuine faith). Both cite Abraham (Romans 4; James 2:21-23) but for different purposes. Paul points to Abraham's initial faith in Genesis 15:6 as the basis of his justification. James points to Abraham's obedience in offering Isaac (Genesis 22) as proof that his faith was genuine and not mere intellectual assent. Paul battles works-righteousness and legalism. James battles dead orthodoxy and antinomianism. Paul says, "We are saved by faith alone." James says, "The faith that saves is never alone." Luther himself eventually recognized this, saying genuine faith is a "living, busy, active, mighty thing." Ephesians 2:8-10 beautifully harmonizes both: "saved by grace through faith... not by works... [but] created in Christ Jesus to do good works." The Reformers captured this with the phrase: "Justification is by faith alone, but the faith that justifies is never alone."
